# Dataset Instruction

## We collect all the constraints for 
(1) axial-vector/vector, axial-vector/axial-vector, vector/vector, 
(2) pseudoscalar/scalar, pseudoscalar/pseudoscalar, scalar/scalar, 
(3) tensor/tensor, pseudotensor/tensor, and pseudotensor/pseudotensor interactions 
generated by the exchange of a single boson of mass $M$ between fermions $X$ and $Y$.

## $V_1$ Results
1. See the file named  [V1_data.md](./V1/V1_data.md) for organized details, and the data are presented in the folder [V1alphadataLei](./V1/V1alphadataLei/)

2. See the file named  [$g_g_s$.md]() for organized details, and the data are presented in the folder [g_g_sdata]().
