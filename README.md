# Dataset Instruction

## We collect all the constraints for 
(1) axial-vector/vector, axial-vector/axial-vector, vector/vector, 
(2) pseudoscalar/scalar, pseudoscalar/pseudoscalar, scalar/scalar, 
(3) tensor/tensor, pseudotensor/tensor, and pseudotensor/pseudotensor interactions 
generated by the exchange of a single boson of mass $M$ between fermions $X$ and $Y$.

See [V1_data](./V1_data.md) for orgnized details and the data are presented in the folder [V1alphadataLei](./V1alphadataLei).
