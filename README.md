# Dataset Instruction

## We collect all the constraints for 
(1) axial-vector/vector, axial-vector/axial-vector, vector/vector, \\
(2) pseudoscalar/scalar, pseudoscalar/pseudoscalar, scalar/scalar, \\
(3) tensor/tensor, pseudotensor/tensor, and pseudotensor/pseudotensor interactions, \\
generated by the exchange of a single boson of mass $M$ between fermions $X$ and $Y$.

The dataset was originally collected for the review: [Spin-dependent exotic interactions](
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2408.15691).
